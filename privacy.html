            <p>Welcome to <strong>Chibi Survivors</strong>! We are committed to protecting the privacy of our players
                ("Survivors"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you
                play our game.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We believe in minimal data collection. We only collect data necessary to improve your gameplay experience
                and serve relevant content.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Model, OS version, and language settings to ensure
                    compatibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Gameplay Data:</strong> Progress, levels unlocked, and in-game economy stats (Gold/Gems) to
                    save your journey.</li>
                <li><strong>Crash Logs:</strong> Anonymous reports to help us fix bugs and glitches.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>We may use third-party services to support our game infrastructure (e.g., for analytics, ads, or cloud
                saves). These partners have their own privacy policies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unity Ads / Google AdMob:</strong> To deliver rewarded video ads.</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase / Google Analytics:</strong> To understand how the game is played and improve
                    balance.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Play Games / Apple Game Center:</strong> For achievements and cloud saves.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To save your game progress and inventory locally or in the cloud.</li>
                <li>To show optional "Rewarded Ads" (e.g., "Watch Ad for Gems") explicitly requested by you.</li>
                <li>To analyze specific difficulty spikes (e.g., "Are players dying too much on Map 3?") to balance the
                    game.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Chibi Survivors is designed for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
                children under the age of 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such data, please contact
                us immediately, and we will delete it.</p>

            <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your data. You can reset your local save data directly
                within the game settings ("Delete Account" / "Reset Progress"). For cloud data deletion requests, please
                contact us.</p>

            <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in our game (e.g., new multiplayer features). Significant
                changes will be announced in the game's news feed.</p>
