            <h2>2. License</h2>
            <p>We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the application for

                <li>Cannot be exchanged for real money or real goods.</li>
                <li>Are legally licensed to you, not sold. We reserve the right to manage, regulate, or eliminate
                    virtual currency at our discretion (e.g., for game balancing).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>

                <li>Limitation of Liability</li>
                <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Chibi Survivors and its developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of data, loss of progress, loss of profits, or business interruption, arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the game, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall our total liability exceed the amount you paid (if any) for the game or related in-app purchases in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</p>

            <h2>5. Content Warning</h2>
            <p>Chibi Survivors contains fantasy violence, stylized combat, and "monster slaying." While the art style is
                "Chibi" (cute), the game involves eliminating hordes of enemies. It is intended for audiences
                comfortable with fast-paced action games.</p>

            <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
            <p>The game is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that the game will be
                error-free or uninterrupted, though we try our hardest to polish every pixel.</p>

            <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the game constitutes your
                acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
